# Language-Detection

## **Description:**

* **Language detection is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves identifying the language of a text or document. It is a challenging task, as there are over 7,000 known languages in the world, and many of them are very similar.**

* **There are a number of different machine learning techniques that can be used for language detection. One common approach is to use a statistical model that is trained on a large corpus of text in multiple languages. The model learns to identify the features that are characteristic of each language, and then uses these features to predict the language of an unknown text.**

* **Another approach to language detection is to use a neural network. Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that can learn complex relationships between features. Neural networks have been shown to be very effective for language detection, and they are often used in commercial products such as Google Translate.**
